The app is installed on your phone and will not disappear when you unplug the USB cable.

However, it's installed as a debug version. This means:

It will have a "Debug" banner.
It might run a bit slower than a final version.
It's not optimized for release.
How to Create a Permanent, Shareable Version (Release APK)
To create a final, optimized version that you can share or keep on your phone permanently, you need to build a release APK.

Here's how you can do it:

Open the terminal in VS Code (or any command prompt in your project folder).
Run the following command:
flutter build apk --release
This will create a high-performance, optimized APK file.

Where to Find the APK
After the build is complete, you'll find the APK file in this directory: build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk

You can then take this app-release.apk file, transfer it to your phone (or anyone else's), and install it like any other Android app.
